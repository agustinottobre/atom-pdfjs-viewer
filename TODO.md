-   polish SyncTeX support,
    avoid unnecessary calls if there is no synctex file.

-   fix weird problem with moving pane split  
    maybe mouse events are lost in iframe?
    
***

-   option to open external links with `atom.workspace.open`  
    instead of `shell.openExternal`
    or check whether browser-package is installed?
    
-   support for printing, but properly through system.  
    why garble a perfectly fine PDF through browser printing?

-   re-enable support for Retina displays in style sheet
